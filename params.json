{"name":"WeerAPI","tagline":"A basic KNMI weather API","body":"# WeerAPI: A basic KNMI weather API\r\n\r\nThis is a very basic JSON API for very basic weather data from the\r\n[Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute](http://www.knmi.nl/index_en.html).\r\n\r\nThe KNMI offers no simple API for simple data, so I built this one, which scrapes their website.\r\nCurrently, it only offers a single API call, for the\r\n[latest weather observations](http://www.knmi.nl/actueel/)\r\nat 36 monitoring stations.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nCall http://weer.solidlinks.nl/actueel/ or run your own instance. Be gentle if you want to use mine :)\r\n\r\nThe data format should mostly speak for itself. Units are:\r\n\r\n* Temperatuur is in degrees celcius\r\n* Humidity is a percentage\r\n* Wind speed is in m/s and Beaufort\r\n* Visibility is in meters\r\n* Pressure is in hPa\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n* The data is cached for two minutes. The KNMI refreshes this data every ten minutes.\r\n* The geographical coordinates of the measuring stations are very rough. If you can provide better ones,\r\n  [create an issue](https://github.com/erikr/weerapi/issues/new) or a pull request.\r\n* Please attribute KNMI as a source if you use this.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
